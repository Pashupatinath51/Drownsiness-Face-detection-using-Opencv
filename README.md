1.  Hand Gestures Sound control leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw to control system volume using hand gestures detected via webcam.
By measuring the distance between thumb and index fingertips, it translates finger movements into volume adjustments, providing a touchless, intuitive interface. Ideal for exploring computer vision and gesture-based control applications.

2. Drowsiness face detection project uses Dlibâ€™s face landmark detection to monitor drowsiness by tracking eye aspect ratio (EAR) in real-time.
    By detecting and analyzing key facial landmarks, it identifies when eyes are closed for extended periods, signaling potential drowsiness. An alert system is included to warn users, making it ideal for driver safety applications and fatigue monitoring.
